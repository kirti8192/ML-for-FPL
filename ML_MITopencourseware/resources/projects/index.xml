      <description>The choice of topic for the class project is up to you so long as it clearly pertains to the course material. It is fine to select a topic that is related to your area of research so long as you can isolate a part that is not carried out in collaboration with people outside the class. You are encouraged to collaborate on the project but this is by no means required.</description>
